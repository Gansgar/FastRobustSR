# FastRobustSR
Fast and Robust Superresolution. Converted into Octave from:
http://www1.idc.ac.il/toky/videoProc-07/projects/SuperRes/srproject.html

This code is used by editing and starting the "script.m" with the octave command line.
$octave script.m
 
In this code, some files are not used, but that can be changed by editing mostly line 84 in script.m into 
the desired algorithm.
